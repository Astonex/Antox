###Completed

- Loading and saving of user settings
- Display a welcome screen when using the app for the first time
- Add Friend activity
- Design MainActivity window to hold friends list
- Extended Adapter class for the friends list (show status, online/offline)
- Design ChatActivity window for conversations 
- Extended Adapter class for displaying chat messages (only basic - needs a lot of design improvement)
- Searching through friends list
- Improve the ChatMessagesAdapter ([design goal](http://assets.hardwarezone.com/img/2013/11/messages.jpg)) 
- Store a list of up to date DHT servers (SettingsActivity)
- Add a QR scanner for adding friends and generating a QR of the users own public key
- Fix app crashing when you launch barcode scanner then back out of it
- When adding a friend, check the key is at least of proper length and only A-z 0-9


###In Progress

- Implement all the callbacks 
- Documenting the current code base

###TODO

- Start adding fail-safes: Notify user when they're not connected to the internet, automatically try different DHT nodes if it can't connect to the first one, restart ToxService if it catches an exception, etc.
- Implement a blocking list so that user never sees friend requests from a blocked ID (very low priority)
- Take this script, http://markwinter.me/script.html which fetches the table of nodes from http://wiki.tox.im/Nodes before parsing them for working nodes, and implement it in the app instead.
