=====

Antox is an Android client for Tox. It aims to bring the full multimedia support Tox offers to your device, although it's still currently in heavy development. Antox is built on current design guidelines, and is both fast and fluid. Support for stickers, geo-location, and other various services offered by other competeting applications are currently being decided upon.

###Submitting Bug Reports
When submitting a bug report, please include the following:-
- Phone Model
- Android Verison
- Custom ROM?
- Error report (please give as much information as possible, not just a couple lines from logcat)


###TODO

- Start adding fail-safes: Notify user when they're not connected to the internet, automatically try different DHT nodes if it can't connect to the first one, restart ToxService if it catches an exception, etc.
- Implement a blocking list so that user never sees friend requests from a blocked ID (very low priority)
- Add a 'paranoid' mode to the app so nothing at all is saved (very low priority)
